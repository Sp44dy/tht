# Contributing

Right now I am mainly open to the following:
- Bug fixes
- Multi-platform support (including Windows)
- Unit test coverage (see the `testsite` readme)
- Security testing & feedback. I try to comment the source code with `[security]` to call out security-related sections.

## New Features
I want to lead implementation on new features for now, so that the higher-level design decisions are consistent.

## Performance
It's probably too early to optimize for performance.  We will wait until the implementation is stable.

Thanks!
